## Overview

Grover's Algorithm is one of the most important quantum algorithms in terms of showcasing potential advantages of quantum methods over classical solutions. It provides a *quadratic* speedup on unstructed search problems compared to classical algorithms, bringing the time complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$.

In this project, I seek to implement Grover's Algorithm using Qiskit in order to solve a 3-Qubit unique search problem.
